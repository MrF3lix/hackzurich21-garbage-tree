## Inspiration

As part of the [HackZurich 2021](https://hackzurich.com/) we worked on the challenge by Janssen of Johnson & Johnson: Make medical product information accessible. The main goal is to replace the paper leaflet from the package. But some problems arise. How do we access/present the digital counterpart, who manages the different versions and how do we ensure the reliability of the information. We mainly focus on the presentation of the information.

## How we built it

The project was mostly implemented with React. Some data gathering was done with Python.

## Challenges we ran into

The main challenge was to find a way to process the text based leaflets and give patients an easy and understandable way to access the relevant information.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Our generalized idea about dependency graphs and versioning for research papers in general.

## What's next for Garbage_Tree

- Try ideas on how to store the data in a good way relating to availability, verifiability and accessability.
- Reference research papers with the respective uncertainty to make the trustworthyness transparent.
- Create a versioning system that not only allows for different language/regional content but also for changes made after drug approval.
